    <ul> 
        <li>Large oven-safe rectangular casserole dish</li>
        <li>One yellow onion (large)</li>
        <li>Cooking oil of choice (olive)</li>
        <li>Couple cloves of garlic </li>
        <li>1.5lb of ground beef (any %, we use lean)</li>
        <li>2 ~14.5 oz cans of petit cut tomatoes</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp of chopped dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of butter</li>
        <li>3 cups of milk</li>
        <li>2.5 tbsp of flour</li>
        <li>4 cups of mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>Aluminum foil</li>
        <li>(Optional) Ketchup or two tbsp of tomato paste</li>
        <li>(Optional) Parmesan, shredded or grated</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Meat Sauce</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop onion and garlic very finely.</li>
        <li>Sauté garlic and onion until soft in large pot, using cooking oil of choice on high heat.</li>
        <li>Add in ground beef, stirring until cooked thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Add ~2 cans of petit cut tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Add ~1.5 tbsp chopped dried basil leaves, add salt and pepper to taste. </li>
        <li>Cover and simmer on medium-low heat ~20-25 minutes until some (not all) of the liquid has boiled off.</li>
        <li>(Optional) Add two tbsp of tomato paste (or squeeze of ketchup) to thicken.</li>
    </ol>


<h2>White Cheese Sauce</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt ~2 tbsp of butter in medium pot on low-medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add in ~2.5 tbsp of flour and stir thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Adding in a small pour of milk at a time, on low-medium heat, stir vigorously to incorporate the milk into the butter-flour mixture. Do this one small pour at a time until all 3 cups of milk are incorporated. </li>
        <li>‼️ Take your time! Make sure that the milk that is poured into the pot a little bit at a time is well-incorporated before next small pour of milk, to prevent unwanted clumping. It should become easier to incorporate the milk into the butter-flour mixture after a few rounds. </li>
        <li>Once all the milk is used, bring the pot to boiling point, then turn the heat down as to not boil over, then simmer for ~3 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add ~2.5 cups of mozzarella and stir. </li>
        <li>Once the cheese is incorporated, add salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Keep on low and stir, as to not let the sauce film over if you are still working on boiling the lasagna strips. </li>
    </ol>
